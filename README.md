# Prediction of Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome in Women - Binary Classification

## Introduction 
The endocrine disorder of Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome(PCOD) is one of the major causes of infertility in women of child bearing age.
Long term hormonal imbalance from PCOS also leads to type 2 diabetes and heart disease. If predicted early this could protect women's  health. 
Hence the goal of this project was to do early prediction of PCOS in women based on clinial 
metabolic tests.
